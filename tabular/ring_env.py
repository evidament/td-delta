    This is based on the ring MDP environment found in:

    Kearns, Michael J., and Satinder P. Singh. "Bias-Variance Error Bounds for Temporal Difference Updates." In COLT, pp. 142-147. 2000.
    

    ``In this problem, we have a Markov process with 5 states arranged in a ring. At each step,
    there is probability 0.05 that we remain in our current state, and probability 0.95 that we
    advance one state clockwise around the ring. (Note that since we are only concerned with the
    evaluation of a fixed policy, we have simply defined a Markov process rather than a Markov
    decision process.) Two adjacent states on the ring have reward +1 and -1 respectively,
    while the remaining states have reward 0. The standard random walk problem has a chain
    of states, with an absorbing state at each end; here we chose a ring structure simply to avoid
    asymmetries in the states induced by the absorbing state.''
